# Payment Dates SDK

## Purpose And Specifications

This is an application to calculate salary and salary bonus dates with following business rules.

• Staff get their basic monthly pay on the last working day of the month (MON-
FRI).
If the last day of the month is a Saturday or Sunday, the payment date will be
the previous Friday.

• On the 10th of every month bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless the
10 th is Saturday or Sunday. In that case, staff get their bonuses on the first
Tuesday after the 10th.
